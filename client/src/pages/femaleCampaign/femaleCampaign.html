    <h4> Meet a sweet Savage </h4>
    <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/sweetSavage.jpg">

    <p>We were able to interview a new entrepreneur in the clothing industry by the name of Ashley Tioni.
      She is currently the Owner of Rose and Raja, which is a brand targeted primarily to women. We wanted to get to know
      her a bit more and wanted you guys to as well.</p>

    <b> “I am 19 years old born and raised in Metro Detroit. I have always had a creative mindset, expressing myself through
      songwriting, poetry, digital content creation and drawing. I grew up an introvert and stayed to myself most of the time
      either reading or writing. It wasn’t until I observed that the extroverts at my school and church were the ones making
      a name for themselves, getting the biggest roles in plays or simply getting the most attention. So at around 13,
      I made up in my mind to push myself outside of my comfort zone and start sharing my work, sharing my talents so I can
      have the recognition that I felt I deserved. Though I have failed during some of my efforts to gain attention and build
      a reputation for myself, I definitely learned a lot which has shaped me into the young woman that I am today.”</b>
    <p> From this point Cyrus pursued his march, through Syria a single stage—five parasangs—to Myriandus, a city inhabited by
      Phoenicians, on the sea-coast. This was a commercial port, and numerous merchant vessels were riding at anchor in the
      harbour. Here they halted seven days, and here Xenias the Arcadian general, and Pasion the Megarian got on board a
      trader, and having stowed away their most valuable effects, set sail for home; most people explained the act as the
      outcome of a fit of jealousy, because Cyrus had allowed Clearchus to retain their men, who had deserted to him, in
      hopes of returning to Hellas instead of marching against the king; when the two had so vanished, a rumour spread that
      Cyrus was after them with some ships of war, and some hoped the cowards might be caught, others pitied them, if that
      should be their fate.</p>

    <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/issaAnimal.png">

    <p>  Everyone has some type of story of when they started their business venture and why. Some stories may be similar,
      but for Ashley it started based off of a strong passion for owning something of her own:</p>

    <b>  “My business is Rose and Raja; a clothing brand that currently features tees and crop tops for the summer.
      Our aim for anyone who follows us or reps our clothes is to Live Young, Wild & Free. Meaning that we want our
      customers to aspire to live in a way where they have the confidence to be daring and bold enough to follow their dreams,
      work hard towards their goals and have financial freedom to do what they want whenever they want.</b>

    <b> I started Rose and Raja May 2017 after coming home from college for the summer.
      Rose and Raja was a passion project initiated out of boredom. All my friends were working their summer jobs,
      doing research programs, internships and studying abroad and I was at home doing NOTHING. I’ve always been
      interested in fashion and I always had a passion to own my own business. With so much free time on my hands
      I figured this would be a great time to start.” </b>

    <p>  A lot of businesswoman we’ve interviewed told us that their family and friends were the ones who influenced
      them to own their own business. Now for Ashley, her influence remains the same as everyone else, but instead
      she wants to prove her influence completely wrong: </p>

    <b> “My influence to start this company was my mother. Before moving in with my dad at 15 I left my mothers abusive
      household. I had extreme punishments from running up and down stairs 100s of times, standing in the garage for
      hours at a time in the dark, getting hit with a whip, wooden club and belt buckles, getting my hair cut and many
      other punishments that I took in for years. Also dealing with the threats to put me in a girls home or telling me
      how ditsy or stupid I was. </b>

    <b>  All moments in my mom’s house weren’t negative, but it sure did entice me to prove her wrong. We rarely spoke about
      dreams, and I knew I wanted to do something, anything that would make her proud. We don’t talk much now, but one
      day I plan for her to see me running my company, doing great things that she never thought I could do. She won’t
      have to say it, but I know she’ll be proud of her “ditsy” daughter.” </b>

    <p> Passions are one of many ­pieces that drives a business to continue to grow and be successful. Like any visionary,
      Ashley wants to create content that she hopes inspires others to do the same. </p>

    <b>  “My passion is to create and inspire others to do the same. I have always found pleasure in making something
      and sharing it with others. In high school I would make a poem everyday and share it with all my friends on Kik.
      It meant the world to me when I had people tell me “I needed this” or “This really made my day”.
      Knowing that the things I create can cause positive feelings towards someone else is a beautiful feeling and only
      makes me want to make more and more.” </b>

      <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/roseAndRaja.jpg">

    <p> Behind every name is an even broader message. This also translates into the type of clothing you sell, etc.</p>

    <b> “Roses symbolize love and respect. Raja means radiance. I like to think of them together as a healthy balance
      of sweet and strong. I love using the term Sweet Savage because I feel that it fits with what Rose and Raja
      stands for. You can be kind and considerate while also being driven and ambitious. I feel that this is something
      I have been trying to maintain and I feel that there are others who want to do the same.”</b>

    <p> With any brand that is targeted primarily for women, the men want to rep the brand a little bit too.
      So when we asked Ashley about making the brand unisex, this is what she told us: </p>

      <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/stayWoke.jpg">

    <b> “Rose and Raja is targeted mainly for women, but we have a lil’ something for the
      men who want to rep the Rose and Raja brand.” </b>

    <p> As a part of being an entrepreneur, one should strive to leave a mark on the work or make
      some type of change. That should always be the main goal, so we asked Ashley what she hopes to
       do to impact the world:</p>

    <b>  “I plan to leave my mark by simply being myself and being as genuine as I can. I feel like there are a lot of people pleasers in the world who are trying to cater to trends, their friends and families or what society says is “cool”. I love me and to leave any mark you must be original and unique. I know I was created for a purpose, but that purpose cannot be fulfilled if I am trying to be like someone else. I am working hard to do what I believe God has sent me here to do, and if I accomplish what I can, I am positive that my mark will be left and remembered.” </b>

    <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/bewareOfKitty.jpg">

    <p> We females do run this world, no matter what anybody says. As time goes on,
      so many females are rising up and becoming entrepreneurs just like Ashley has.
      We are dominating in everything that we do. </p>

    <b> “Being a female entrepreneur is fun! People are impressed because so many men are dominating
      the workplace and to see women step up, makes other women feel empowered. I love meeting other girl
      bosses because we come up with great ideas and we have style that men cannot compete with! It just
      makes me feel good to simply talk with other young women about their brands, helping each other out
       and just growing bigger and better. To be apart of that is amazing and I am so glad that I have
       decided to become a female entrepreneur.” </b>

       <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/savageMami.jpg">

    <p> Rose and Raja is a brand that sells graphic tees and crops, many of their products have sayings on
       them. We wanted to figure out the inspiration and story behind why she chose a lot of what she’s selling:
     </p>

     <b> “I used to get in trouble for being terribly honest. One time at church this older guy complimented my
       hair and said he wished he had long hair like mine. I told him he could get long hair…if he used Bosley.
       My mom snatched me so quick and told me I hurt his feelings, but I thought I was offering a solution to
       his problem. He looked so sad once I told him that, so I decided from that point on to sugarcoat the
       truth so I wouldn’t hurt people’s feelings.  </b>

     <b> I say all that because I noticed that as I got older I wouldn’t be direct or
       honest with people, and that bothered me. I got so used to holding in what I really
       felt that I felt uncomfortable being bold and direct. So when I made the Issa Animal
       Introductory Collection for Rose and Raja I took that as an opportunity to be bold, to say
       what people may be thinking but would never say out loud. My first design was “Beware of Kitty”
       and once I finished that one, the rest just poured out.”</b>

       <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/savageMami2.jpg">
     <p>  The future should be something any entrepreneur should constantly think about because growth is key.
       You don’t ever want to be the same person or brand you were a year ago. Grow, get out and do more
       research, but most importantly plan wisely. In ten years, Rose and Raja plans to:</p>

     <b> “…travel the world, with signature pieces and an identity that is unmatched by other streetwear
       designers. I see storefronts, loyal customers, features in magazines, a strong team fueling the
       Rose and Raja image. I see real tigers wearing real roses, working with influencers I’ve idolized
       for years, having memorable events and so much more. Overall I see major growth, and we grow more
       and more each day, so in 10 years I can only imagine where we’ll be. </b>

       <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/iPrey.jpg">

     <b> As of now I’m planning to get as many eyeballs as I can on the Rose and Raja brand.
       This time next year I plan to have a few fashion shows under my belt as well as introduce our
       newest collection. There is so much work that needs to be done, but we can take the heat.
       I am so excited for what the future has to offer and to continue growing Rose and Raja.” </b>

    <p> From one brand to another, we wish you nothing but the best. You are new and fresh in the
      clothing industry and we hope that you are/continue to soak up as much knowledge as you can.
      Timing is EVERYTHING. Never rush greatness. There will be doubters, but don’t let that detour
       you from what you want and dream to do. Again good luck and have fun. </p>

      <h4>Meet a Young Woman with No Filter</h4>
      <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/womanWithNoFilter.jpg">
      <p>We had the opportunity of interviewing the lovely Brea Spencer,
         who is from the West side of Detroit. We call her a woman with no filter because based off of what
         we see she says what she means and means what she says… literally. For the campaign, we wanted to
         showcase women who were creative and also had a strong voice and message behind what their doing
         and she for sure does. Brea is the Founder of Selfish clothing brand. Selfish is a newer brand that
         sells tees and cropped tees with bold sayings on them. It most definitely caught our Founder’s eye
         and made her want to get to know about Brea even more.
      </p>

      <p>Selfish was established in early May of this year and even though its still fresh it has been getting
        an abundance of love and support. Starting a business and having a strong friend support system is
        such an important thing and Brea’s support system can show for it:
      </p>

      <b> “Selfish launched on May 1, 2017 and the idea came around sometime in March. Initially, I wanted to
        start a business making my own clothes. I have a sewing machine that I literally don’t use, at all.
        But I knew that would be way more time consuming. I was texting my best friends one day (my biggest supporters)
        and again we were throwing out ideas and the tiny crop tops came up and here we are today.
        No one has looked at me differently since starting my business. I’ve actually been getting so much support from
        people I don’t even know. It’s crazy. It’s amazing.” </b>

        <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/yesTheFuck1.jpg">

        <p>Of course we know what the word “selfish” means, but we wanted to dig deeper as to why she
          chose the word and how she wants others to define it: </p>

        <b> “To me Selfish is all about representing bad ass women, all women. All colors, shapes, and sizes.
          My best friends actually helped me come up with the name. We took a lot of different words and searched
           synonyms for them and just sent them to our group message. It was my best friend Tangela who actually
            threw out Selfish and I loved it as soon as I saw it. The message behind the name Selfish is that
            women simply deserve to be selfish. I don’t mean Selfish in a way that’s malicious or harmful to
            others, but a good Selfish, meaning that you and only you are your priority.”</b>

        <p> The message behind her brand is just so strong and it’s a way that any female should live her life…
          as selfish as she can be… but in a good way of course.
          With any female targeted brand, there’s always questions about if they’ll try and target the males
           because majority of the time they want to support, but can’t because of the way its targeted. We
           popped the question if Brea was open to having a unisex brand: </p>

       <b>“Men’s Wear was never in the original plan for Selfish. However, I’ve been getting a lot of
             feedback from guys wanting to rock Selfish. So I decided to included the guys in a few t-shirts
             but for now the quotes will still be all about empowering women.”</b>

       <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/selfish.jpg">
       <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/selfish2.jpg">

       <p> As an entrepreneur, the future should always find its way of creeping in your mind.
         Constantly thinking about what you need to do better, where you want to be or do to grow your
         brand to bigger and better. When we talked about the future of Selfish, Brea had big goals and
         accomplishments to check off her list: </p>

       <b>“Wow, in 10 years I would love for Selfish to be much bigger than it is now.
         A cute little store front in downtown Detroit and in NYC are my biggest goals.
         In the future I’d like Selfish to be a more of a higher end street-wear but I honestly
         love seeing people style their crop tops different based on their personal style.”</b>

         <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/yesTheFuck2.jpg">
         <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/brainsBeauty.jpg">
         <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/brainsBeauty2.jpg">


         <p> Being a young boss can have its challenges, but it can also have a lot of pros.
            Our job as entrepreneurs are never easy, you will honestly never know when things
             will go bad, but you’ll always have to get prepared for the worst thing. Since Brea
             has a new business, we wanted to ask if she has had any challenges starting off and
             basically how it feels to be a young, black entrepreneur:
         </p>

         <b> “It feels great being a young black boss/entrepreneur. It does get challenging
           sometimes especially when you do everything on your own but I would advise other
            young entrepreneurs is to never give up. Running a business is not easy but you have
            to remember why you started and know that all the hard work and stress will all be worth
             it in the end.”</b>
          <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/cardigan.jpg">
          <p> With any entrepreneur, we receive inspiration from anything really.
             Whether music, listening to a motivational speaker, etc.
             This inspiration we receive we channel it into our products/art.
             A lot of Selfish’s crop tees have bold statement on them like
             “Yes The Fuck I Can” etc., so we wanted to know where exactly
             the inspiration behind it came from or if it was a mood:</p>
          <b> “I listen to music, podcast, and videos just to get inspiration for the quotes.
            All of them are definitely my mood. My favorite would have to be the “Yes The Fuck I Can” top.
             When I wear it I just feel like I can achieve everything I put my mind to that day.”</b>

          <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/yesTheFuck3.jpg">
          <p>We like to say that females are a jack of all trades. We can be so
             talented at so many things and look so great doing it. Brea isn’t just a
              businesswoman, but also has another passion that goes hand and hand with her brand:</p>

          <b>“Besides Selfish, I’m a freelance photographer. Photography is my life and I hope to
              continue taking pictures for as long as I can.” </b>

          <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/yesTheFuck4.jpg">

          <p>Brea, we want to thank you for letting us interview you for your brand.
            Selfish is such a unique brand and will go so far. Keep the motivation and
            drive that you have, never let that light you have die out. People will try
            to steal that light, but never let them. Everything you want you will accomplish
            when you put your mind to it. So continue being the badass businesswoman you are
            and enjoy yourself.</p>

          <h4>Meet a ‘Country Girl’ from NJ.</h4>

<img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/girlFromNJ.jpg">
<p>We are taking things all the way to New Jersey where we where able to interview a beautiful,
   ‘country girl’ by the name of Cierra Jaye’. Our Founder, Amir, discovered her work on Twitter
   about two years ago and completely fell in love. Cierra, Owner of Thrilla Seven, hand makes
   all of her products to fit her and her customers needs.  A true talent! We are so excited to
   have gotten in touch to interview her about her 5-year old baby, Thrilla Seven.
   Thrilla Seven is most definitely a brand that catches eyes for one of many reasons… originality.
   If you take a scroll through her site you will be able to see a variety of hand-made products
   from sequin dresses,
   oversized tees, bikinis, statements tees and so much more. Her brand’s versatility pleases everybody’s needs
   (even men’s clothing). Of course many of you may want to know the significance behind the brand’s
   name as well as when it was established, so Cierra let us know:</p>

   <b>Thrilla Seven was established on July 7th, 2012 and began due to a passion
     I had for creating clothing, not only for myself but for others as well.
      Which led to creating designs for people to wear at the college I attended and
       all just seemed to blossom from there. </b>

   <b> ‘Thrilla’ is daring, edgy, full of charisma. It was originally a nickname I was given
     and it describes my style well. 'Seven’ is my favorite number for many MANY reasons and
     also represents charm, completion and has a timeless recognition with 'class’ and 'grace’.
      The two terms balance each other well. </b>

  <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/girlFromNJ2.jpg">
  <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/girlFromNJ3.jpg">
  <p> Being able to empower and encourage people happens to be one of Cierra’s passions.
    She says, “I ultimately want my designs to do that and bring people together.
    I love to explore and to help others see things from different perspectives.
    I love learning about people and different areas.” This is most definitely shown throughout her work,
    making young ladies around the world feel beautiful as well as look it.</p>

    <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/determinedYoung.jpg">

    <p>Now this talented designer has one of the talents any designer should pick up,
      which is sewing. Her first encounter with hand sewing was at the age of 7.
      “My grandmother taught me. When I was in Seventh grade however, I took a Home Economics
      class where I first learned how to use a sewing machine. I’d teach myself new things all
      the time once I got my first sewing machine that same school year.” Cierra mentions that her
      first piece was actually in her sophomore year of college. “I made a dress for a dance and I
       did each side (half/half) in a different fabric. Half hot pink, the other half half hot pink/white
       stripe. I just wanted something that I knew I wouldn’t see someone else wearing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any designers dream is to have a well known person wear their clothing.
       Even though Thrilla Seven hasn’t been worn yet by a well known individual,
       she hopes to would ultimately want to have Rihanna or Taraji P. Henson where any of her items.
       We wanted to get a sense of Cierra’s style and how she creates, whether getting feedback from her
       customers or making things she would only wear. So this is what she had to say:
    </p>

    <b> “In-the-moment, daring and limitless. I create things I’d love to wear and then tweak the designs
      to what I know many others would be able to wear/enjoy as well. My designs express my personal style
      to a tee.”</b>

      <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/redLace.jpg">
      <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/blackLace.jpg">

      <p>
        A lot of the girl bosses we’ve been interviewing so far have had family who’ve influenced
        them to own their own business and this seems to be the same for Cierra. When she spoke to
         us about her influences who keep her going when she feels like she’s failed, she spoke highly
          of her grandmother and her good friend K. Owning a business and running it all by yourself can
          be hard and there are times where you can be so down on yourself and feel like you failed and
          having a great support system be there for you in those moments are super important.
        We ask that all of our girl bosses we interview could give advice to the upcoming female entrepreneurs
        and this is what Cierra had to say to you guys:
      </p>

      <b>
         “Stay true to your heart. it’s beating and screaming at you for a reason. when it feels right to
         YOU, do it. never quit and never doubt yourself. your vision was given to you for a reason.”
      </b>

      <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/dress.jpg">

      <p>Of course we had to be nosey and see what’s up next for both Cierra and Thrilla Seven.
         Her latest collection is Thrilla Sport®. Cierra let us know that her FW ’17 collection will
         be released soon, so make sure you guys check out your brand’s IG for more information.</p>

    <p> We want to continue to wish you the best with Thrilla Seven with even more success.
      Continue to grow and be the best Cierra Jaye’ you can be and a great rolemodel for the
      young gals. Thank you for taking the time out with us for this interview.

      <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/youngVisionary.jpg">

      <p>Meet a Young Visionary: We had the opportunity of interviewing a young bright,
        talented soul by the name of Kaylan Jefferson. Many of you may also know her as
        “The Visionary Boss.” She’s currently taking the world by storm with her blog
         platform that showcases her style, writing, other influential women, but she’s also
         launched her own organization at the age of nineteen. Whew! Now that she has inspired us,
         we hope that you become inspired too.
       </p>

       <p>Now for starters, she’s very confident with who she is and what she does.
         When we asked her about herself, some of her goals, and basically her influences
         this is what she had to say:</p>

        <p>  “I like the refer to myself as the one & only muse. I use the rhythm of my conversation
          and words to create intimate, vulnerable think pieces, to witty narratives and self-improvement,
           and candid, groundbreaking content. I’m newly nineteen years old and it feels wonderful.
           I have always been a huge life enthusiast. Funny, I’m somewhat of an introvert,
           but I have a fondness for communication and networking. When I was younger my passions
           ranged from wanting to being an author, a fashion designer, to a cinematographer. Nonetheless,
           in one sense or another, I wanted to be a boss. A CEO! Hence my blog and platform: The Visionary
            Boss. I was born up north, but have lived in Tampa for pretty much all of my life. As far as
            influential women in my life, I would definitely pay homage to my mother: a queen, a beautiful
            soul and a great confidant, all in one. My mom has always supported me and been someone I look up
            to, entrepreneurial wise and more. She has this eclectic, earthy, warm approach to everything she
            does. Her seamless nature almost seems effortless, at times. That’s the kind of boss I want to be—I
            want to execute my passions and moves in a natural, fitting way.”</p>


        <p> Not only has Kaylan been an influencer herself, she has also been influenced
          by someone very close to her to start her on business venture. When we asked Kaylan
          about who influenced her to start her own business, she said:</p>

          <b>“My mother has influenced me to start my own business, because she was an entrepreneur and a
            self-made business woman at the age of nineteen. I am gracefully following her lead. Being a
            business owner is humbling, because I’m constantly challenging myself. Everyday, I am trying
            different methods to reach an audience. At the moment, I am selling sophisticated, sleek sunglasses.
             For $5 you can either get a cup of coffee, or a beautifully crafted pair of sunnies from an
             independent, black-owned business. I started the Visionary Boss Shop when I was a senior in
             high school. I remember investing my money into the project, getting a great model to showcase
             the shades, and taking the photos for them. I was told that my idea was ‘small’ and 'good-luck
             growing my little business,’ by an individual at the time. Now, I just smile, because I’m genuinely
             happy that I got the experience of creating and developing my own merchandise.
             No one can take that away from me. I do not wear it on my sleeve, but I am proud to call myself an
             entrepreneur.” </b>

          <p> Your brand has to be very unique and the name has to along with some type of message.
            We thought that “The Visionary Boss” was very unique and wanted to figure out what the meaning
            was behind it:</p>

            <b> “The Visionary Boss is not an alter ego or alias. It is merely my reality.
              Being a Visionary Boss is dreaming, envisioning and creating an aesthetic of your own
              while making waves. I am creating visuals, literature and content with simplistic,
              realistic concepts and story lines that have life-changing tendencies and perspectives.
              Rewind to my sophomore year of high school. Second semester. During this time in my life,
              I was in the process of preparing for a pageant. I made it through the auditions, initial
              interviews, the practices, panels of judges before the show, the photo-shoots and finally
              the dress rehearsals. The morning of the pageant, we had rehearsal and the host and main coordinator
              of the show gave all the girls the run-down of the live show and some questions we’d have the answer,
              after the 'runway’ portion of the show. “Describe yourself in one word.” That’s what he told us.
              From that moment on, 'visionary’ just was ingrained to me. I’m an introspective, deep thinker.
              I reminisce while dreaming of the future to create a present. It is always my season.”</b>

              <p>Being a female entrepreneur has become more common in today’s age.
                 One thing that can detour a lot of people away is how to start and where to start.
                  Getting your idea from pen and paper to reality can be hard, but it’s not impossible.
                   Our young visionary had a few words for our young, upcoming entrepreneurs:</p>

             <b>“My advice for aspiring, young entrepreneurs is to plan accordingly and to be realistic.
               A blog, a business or any passion project does not happen overnight—but it does require late nights.
               Being strategic and thinking ahead is my best advice. Also, less is more. You do not need to tackle
               a million different avenues to be seen as a worthy entrepreneur. Minimalism is a beautiful thing.
                Have a clean-cut office setting to do your work, be organized and ahhhhhh, take a deep breath.
                I’m all for being on my grind, but if something is effecting my mental state, then I will take a break.
                This summer, I’m balancing my summer pre-med classes, my full-time marketing coordinating job, and the
                glorious thing I call my blog: The Visionary Boss. 24 hours is not enough. Like Ginuwine said, ‘Give me 24,
                give me 24.’ So, basically, I never try to overwork myself. I can simply just get up the next morning
                and get as much as I can do, possible. Real bosses get sleep, haha.
                You asked what problems I’ve faced as a young, black entrepreneur. For starters, being a young,
                black entrepreneur is a market and network of its own. Personally, I have not had any huge,
                underlying issues or obstacles. If anything, I think being a young black woman influencer, entrepreneur
                 and blogger has helped me. But, universally speaking, I do think there is too much of a ‘I’m a bigger boss’
                 elitist competition between young black professionals, bloggers, etc.  The world—at least the independent
                 black marketing and network world would be a lot more vibrant, if people built together. Too many times I
                 scroll down my Insta feed and see young black fashion designers, models, bloggers, influencers and business
                  owners who have this super elitist complex and promote the fact that they have haters and copiers.
                  Yawn! Not everything has to be this elaborate, over the top competition. Just put your heart and soul into
                  your work, be confident in that and network with others.”</b>

              <p>Passion is the one thing that seems to drive any and every one when it comes to their dreams.
                 Kaylan was able to tell us her passions and how she figured out what her passions were at a young age:</p>

              <b>“My number one passion in life is to evoke a feeling of warmth, inspiration and revelation. I have a passion
                for aesthetics, literature, film, the universe, the cosmos, the ocean, the mind and body. I organically figured
                 out my passions when I was fifteen. It was on a Summer night that I call one of my many 'nostalgic nights.’
                 It is the intuition you get about life on a hot summer night or intimate fall evening. It is the reflection
                 along with a dream. I want to create eminent, eclectic masterpieces with ancient allusions, aspects from
                 traditional literature and atmospheric, relevant vibes. And, I want to write. And be a CEO. These are my
                 passions, that may be larger-than-life to some, but heaven sent to me.”</b>

              <p>We live in a society that has powerful women making their marks in every industry. These women to say the least,
                influence majority of us in many ways to pursue our own dreams. Our fellow young boss had a few influential
                 women in mind:</p>

              <b>“There are so many bold, unapologetic women powerhouses. From Ava Duvernay, to Debbie Allen, Oprah Winfrey,
                Issa Rae, to Solange and Beyonce Knowles. Those are women bosses, right there. All of these women are creators,
                 producers and game-changers when it comes to filmmaking, entertainment and creating vivid concepts.
                  I am an aspiring cinematographer and I have filmed, produced, edited and created mini documentaries,
                  short visuals and look-books. In high school, I spent a lot of time dissecting behind-the-scenes and
                  production for music videos, critically-acclaimed movies and even concerts. I wanted to be the modern-day
                  female Spike Lee. But, in all honesty I thank the women mentioned above for inspiring me.”</b>


            <p>There’s always speculation about what the future may hold for many,
               but Kaylan seems to continue to have the bright spirit and drive to succeed and tap into way more in
               the future:</p>

               <b>“I’m going to have a lot of fun with this answer, because I have a dozen vision boards in the back of my
                  head. Ten years from now I will be twenty-nine years old. I will have my pharmacy degree, (cheers to that),
                   and continue to be the CEO of The Visionary Boss. Honestly, I have always envisioned myself living a simplistic,
                   yet larger-than-life life. By 29, I will be married to my equivalent, and he will most likely have a growing
                   business—and we’ll be partners for a business that is something organic or natural, or dealing with fitness.
                   Maybe all three.  I would have successfully spent my twenties, traveling, networking, branding and taking
                   lots of photos, capturing the warm, exciting moments. But honestly, in ten years I want my platform to turn
                   into a brand, and I want to promote my lifestyle to others and be a great CEO.”</b>

       <p>Being a young, black entrepreneur can have its cons but it for sure has its pro’s. Kaylan,
          who is a young, black entrepreneur herself feels the complete opposite of what most may
           think about being a black female entrepreneur:</p>

      <b>“It feels limitless. The only thing stopping young, black entrepreneurs is believing you have to follow a
        specific formula. And trying to separate thyself from older, original influencers to seem
        'different.’ There is nothing wrong with being influenced!”</b>

        <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/youngVisionary3.jpg">
        <p>As a entrepreneur, your number one goal should be making an impact or mark on the world instead of
          sitting around not trying to make change. Honestly, that’s what being an entrepreneur is about… making
          change. When Kaylan was asked about how she plans to make an even bigger impact on the world, this is what
          she had to say:</p>

          <b> “Recently, I started and launched an organization for Top-Shelf, ambitious, creative, well-rounded,
            vibrant young women + boss babes in Tampa who want to network and give back. This organization and
            sisterhood is called MUSE—because I, The Visionary Boss surrounds and supports herself around other
            goddesses who are creative influencers. Through this organization, I want to show representation to
            young WOC and create a refreshing networking environment for like-minded aspiring bosses.”</b>

            <img src="assets/Images/femaleCampaign/museMembership.png">
            <p>We want to thank Kaylan for wanting to be apart of our campaign and being such a boss she is. We hope she has many more successes in the future!
